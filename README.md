Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A simple command-line-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. This project is perfect for learning the basics of game logic, conditionals, loops, and user interaction in Python.

Introduction: This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game played between two players. The game can be run in any terminal or command-line interface, where two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with either "X" or "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Features: Two-player mode, Interactive, Easy to set up and play, Clean, and readable code structure

Technologies Used: Python

How to Play: The game is played on a grid thatâ€™s 3 squares by 3 squares.
Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O".
Players take turns entering their move by choosing a cell numbered 1 to 9.
The goal is to place three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win.

Game Rules: Players take turns to mark a square.
A player wins if they manage to place three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
The game ends in a draw if all squares are filled, and no player has three marks in a row.
